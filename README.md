# Data Engineer Journey — Day 1

## Project: Basic ETL Script

### What I did:
- Set up Python environment with PyCharm
- Installed required libraries (`pandas`, `openpyxl`)
- Created a simple ETL Python script:
  - Extracted data from a dictionary (simulating Excel)
  - Transformed data by calculating total salary
  - Loaded data into a CSV file
- Practiced Git commands and pushed project to GitHub

### Files:
- `etl_employee_salary.py` — Python ETL script
- `employee_salaries.csv` — output CSV file (can be ignored with `.gitignore`)

---

## Next Steps (Day 2)
- Learn data cleaning & handling missing values with Pandas
- Practice reading/writing multiple file formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Begin SQL basics & integration with Python
